Student Information
-------------------

![197 students took this course when it was taught in Spring 2017.](/coursemedia/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/d5012027137282825f1270ed0cd631f9_197.png)

### Enrollment

Between 2008 and 2018, the enrollment for 6.004 rose from about 100 to 200-300 per semester.

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly sophomores, but also others, ranging from freshmen to graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

About 4/5 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, 1/5 other.

### Typical Student Background

Some students came to the class with prior experience in programming and some understanding of how computers are structured; others came knowing little more than how to use a browser.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session;Â  24 sessions total.
*   Class sessions were lecture-based and focused on the engineering of digital systems.

Recitation
----------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total.
*   Recitation groups contained 20-30 students on average and allowed students to work through practice problems and ask questions of the recitation instructors.

Out of Class
------------

*   Outside of class, students completed seven lab assignments, worked through the online materials and practice problems in the MITx version of the course, and prepared a design project.
